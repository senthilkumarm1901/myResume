## Key Projects

### BERT Fine-tuned Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis Pipeline <small><small>[More Details](https://github.com/senthilkumarm1901/senthilkumarm1901/blob/main/project_descriptions/asba.md)</small></small>

- Built a reusable Sequence Classification ML Pipeline which converts customer comments into trackable Aspect and Sentiment pairs
- The ML Pipeline used BERT-fine-tuning and it helped yeilding 85%+ F1 score with minimal annotated data for more than 25+ classes
- Incorporated easy to use human-in-the-loop annotation and model monitoring scripts

<hr>

### Personally Identifiable Information (PII) Detection using Named Entity Recognition (NER) <small><small>[More Details](https://github.com/senthilkumarm1901/senthilkumarm1901/blob/main/project_descriptions/pii_ner.md)</small></small>

- Annonymized PII in text data by building a NER system using **RoBerta Fine-tuned Transformer model**
- Bootstrapped the training data using Spacy rules (thus easing the annotation process by not starting labeling from scratch) 
- Deployed an asynchronous inference REST API (using FastAPI and K8s) that can be plugged into multiple applications

<hr>

### NLP Semantic Search Pipeline <small><small>[More Details](https://github.com/senthilkumarm1901/senthilkumarm1901/blob/main/project_descriptions/semantic_search.md)</small></small>

- Created a "digital thread" by connecting two automotive domain specific data sources 
- The data sources contain technician comments about issues before the launch of a vehicle
- The digital thread was established by assigning NLP-based semantically matching common part descriptions in comments in both datasources
- Purpose: Predict the prominent issues about to occur in a downstream data source by reviewing the issues much earlier in the launch cycle
	
<hr>

### Reusable Text Data Clustering Pipeline <small><small>[More Details](https://github.com/senthilkumarm1901/senthilkumarm1901/blob/main/project_descriptions/text_clustering.md)</small></small>

- Built reusable Text Clustering pipeline with simpler Python APIs for non-NLP analysts
