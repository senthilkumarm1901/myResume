## Key Projects

### Speech2Text Application in AWS Cloud Infrastructure | 2022-23
- Built a ML Pipeline comprising Open Source models converting Call Center audio transcripts to usable insights in dashboard.
- Deployed deep learning models - PyAnnote (for Speaker Diarization) and OpenAI’s Whisper (for Speech2Text) - via docker containers. 
- Partnered with DevOps Engineer to scale the dockerized ML portion using AWS EKS. Scaled the rest of the solution using AWS Serverless components

<hr>

### Serverless LLM-powered Classification Application | 2023
- Leveraged OpenAI paid models (such as GPT 3.5Turbo and GPT-4)  to perform hierarchical text classification
- Utilised AWS Lambda functions to throttle the OpenAI API calls at scale

<hr>

### BERT Fine-tuned Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis Pipeline | 2020-21 <small><small>[More Details](https://github.com/senthilkumarm1901/senthilkumarm1901/blob/main/project_descriptions/asba.md)</small></small>

- Built a Sequence Classification ML Pipeline which converts customer comments into trackable Aspect and Sentiment pairs
- The ML Pipeline used BERT-fine-tuning and it helped yeilding 85%+ F1 score with minimal annotated data for more than 25+ classes
- Incorporated easy to use human-in-the-loop annotation and model monitoring scripts

<hr>

### Personally Identifiable Information (PII) Detection using Named Entity Recognition (NER) | 2020-21 <small><small>[More Details](https://github.com/senthilkumarm1901/senthilkumarm1901/blob/main/project_descriptions/pii_ner.md)</small></small>

- Annonymized PII in text data by building a NER system using **RoBerta Fine-tuned Transformer model**
- Bootstrapped the training data using Spacy rules (thus easing the annotation process by not starting labeling from scratch)

<hr>

### NLP Semantic Search Pipeline | 2021-22 <small><small>[More Details](https://github.com/senthilkumarm1901/senthilkumarm1901/blob/main/project_descriptions/semantic_search.md)</small></small>

- Purpose: Predict the prominent issues about to occur in a downstream data source by reviewing the issues much earlier in the automotive launch cycle
- Created a “digital thread” - a NLP-based semantic similarity matching engine based on automotive part descriptions -  between two automotive domain specific data sources
